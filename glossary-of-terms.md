# Linnia Protocol's Glossary of Terms

1. **Attestation** - A data signature from a trusted source.
2. **Blind computation** - A computation over encrypted data (doesn't give a third party information about what you have inside)
3. **Bounty and staking schemes** - ***Bounty***: Typically ETH or tokens locked in a smart contract and given to those who accomplish a certain action. ***Staking***: Locked ETH or tokens are given as a Bond to the Smart Contract that enables others to trust that the user will not behave in a way we don't want, as it would not be profitable to him. Check *proof of stake* and *payment channels* for more info.
4. **Data Exchange protocol** - A protocol to exchange data and money between different parties
5. **Facets** - Identity-in-context.  For instance, in the context of a person's “health facet,” both medical and driving data may define that person's identity.
6. **Game Theory** - The mathematical proof that cheating does not always pay.
7. **Game-Theoretic Network "Actors" ("Equilibria")** - A point in the system where no actor benefits from changing strategy, as they would lose money. This is the same concept as an equilibrium in physics, but for system human behavior design. 
8. **Garbled Circuits:** A cryptographic protocol which allows two parties to verify the integrity computation over encrypted data without the need for third-parties. 
9. **HD Wallets** - Local brain wallets Check BIP32
10. **Homomorphic Encryption:** A form of encryption that allows computation over encrypted data where the result is the same as if the computation was done on plaintext. There are two kinds of homomorphic encryption; *somewhat* homomorphic encryption and *full* homomorphic encryption. The first one allows only to do either addition or multiplication over the cipher text. On the other hand, full homomorphic encryption allows both operations.
11. **Hub & Spoke Legibility** - The current way by which large-scale tech enterprises have an inward flow of data describing all of their users. The enterprise owns the user's data.
12. **Identity Singleton** - All of the information related to an identity contained in one instantiation.  The single collection of data that an individual can use to coordinate all of their actions across a network.  
13. **Individual Legibility** - The ability for an individual to express information to society about their identities in a trusted way, and without a central authority in order to get what they want.
14. **IPFS** - *inter planetary file system* decentralized storage 
15. **Lagrange Interpolation** - The Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial P of lowest degree that passes through all the points of a certain data set (i.e interpolation of this dataset by the Lagrange polynomial). In Shamir secret sharing, we use this interpolation formula to calculate the value of P(0), which equals the shared secret value.
16. **Legibility**- The ability of identities to express data about themselves to their networks (communities, enterprises, governments, social circles, etc.) in a trusted way.
17. **Merkle DAG** - The directed acyclic graph using merkle hashing. For more information, reference the IPFS white paper.
18. **Network Agency** - The ability to have people trust our data so we can engage with a network.
19. **N-Sided Cooperation** - The opposite of zero-sum games.  When competition strategies are dominated by cooperation. 2. The ability of multiple individuals to exchange permissions and view each other's data.
20. **Non-Agency Information Asymmetries** - Lack of access to information about an identity that results, not from that identity's desire to keep it private, but instead from the cost of making it legible (i.e. cost of completing a search).  
21. **Self-Sovereign Data** - The core component of Web3.0, where your data is wholly owned and controlled by you and not by any outside entity.
22. **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)** -A cryptographic protocol, which allows sharing a secret by dividing it into multiple pieces. Each piece will be shared with one part only.
23. **Secure MultiParty Computation (sMPC)** - A cryptographic method which allows multiple servers to compute functions over encrypted data.
26. **Verified Computation** - A method to enable untrusted parties to do the computation of some function while keeping a proof of the computation in order to verify the correctness of the computation later on.
